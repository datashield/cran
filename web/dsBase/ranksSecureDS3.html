<h2>Secure ranking of &quot;V2BR&quot; (vector to be ranked) across all sources</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>takes key non-disclosive components of the serverside data frame
blackbox.ranks.df over to the clientside to enable global re-ranking of the
global ranks just applying to the real data (not the pseudo-data).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
ranksSecureDS3()
</pre>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Severside aggregate function called by ds.ranksSecure. The
non-disclosive components of blackbox.ranks.df that are transmitted to the
clientside are: (1) final values of the encrypted global ranks vector
after all seven rounds of encryption have been completed; (2) a set of
sequential IDs allocated to the global ranks vector in each study in their
current order based on increasing value of V2BR. This allows later re-linkage
of values back on the serverside and confirmation that that linkage is
correct. (3) a studyid vector with all values n in the nth study. This
facilitates data management on the serverside during the global ranking
of global ranks. For more details about the cluster of functions that
collectively enable secure global ranking and estimation of global quantiles
see the associated document entitled &quot;secure.global.ranking.docx&quot;. Also see
the header file for ds.ranksSecure
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>the non-disclosive elements of blackbox.output.df (see details)
on the serverside as a data frame object (called sR6.df)
on the clientside. After processing within ds.ranksSecure to create the
global ranks and global quantiles (of real data only) across all studies,
this is returned to the serverside as data frame &quot;global.ranks.quantiles.df&quot;
using the clientside function ds.dmtC2S. To illustrate the difference between
ranks and quantiles, if there are a total of 1000 original real observations
across all studies and one particular observation has the rank 250, it will
have quantile value 0.25 (i.e. 25
increasing value). Both ranks and quantiles can have ties. For more details
about the cluster of functions that collectively enable secure global ranking
and estimation of global quantiles see the associated document entitled
&quot;secure.global.ranking.docx&quot;. Also see the header file for ds.ranksSecure
