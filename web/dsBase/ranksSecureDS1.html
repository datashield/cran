<h2>Secure ranking of &quot;V2BR&quot; (vector to be ranked) across all sources</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>takes key non-disclosive components of the serverside data frame
blackbox.output.df over to the clientside to enable global ranking.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
ranksSecureDS1()
</pre>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Severside aggregate function called by ds.ranksSecure. The
non-disclosive components of blackbox.output.df that are transmitted to the
clientside are: (1) final values of the &quot;combined real+pseudo data vector&quot;
after all seven rounds of encryption have been completed; (2) a set of
sequential IDs allocated after sorting the &quot;combined real+pseudo data vector&quot;
by value (in ascending order). This allows later re-linkage of values back on
the serverside and confirmation that that linkage is correct. For more
details about the cluster of functions that collectively enable secure global
ranking and estimation of global quantiles see the associated document
entitled &quot;secure.global.ranking.docx&quot;. Also see the header file
for ds.ranksSecure
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>the non-disclosive elements of blackbox.output.df (see details)
on the serverside as a data frame object (called blackbox.output)
on the clientside. After processing to create the global ranks across all
studies, this is returned to the serverside as the data frame sR4.df using
the clientside function ds.dmtC2S
