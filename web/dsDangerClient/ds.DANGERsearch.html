<h2>lists all R environments on serverside</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>creates a list of the names of all of the serverside
R environments
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
ds.DANGERsearch(datasources = NULL)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>datasources</code></td>
<td>
<p>specifies the particular 'connection object(s)' to use.
e.g. if you have several data sets in the sources you are working with
called opals.a, opals.w2, and connection.xyz, you can choose which of
these to work with. The call 'datashield.connections_find()' lists all of
the different datasets available and if one of these is called 'default.connections'
that will be the dataset used by default if no other dataset is specified. If you
wish to change the connections you wish to use by default the call
datashield.connections_default('opals.a') will set 'default.connections'
to be 'opals.a' and so in the absence of specific instructions to the contrary
(e.g. by specifiying a particular dataset to be used via the &lt;datasources&gt;
argument) all subsequent function calls will be to the datasets held in opals.a.
If the &lt;datasources&gt; argument is specified, it should be set without
inverted commas: e.g. datasources=opals.a or datasources=default.connections.
The &lt;datasources&gt; argument also allows you to apply a function solely to a subset
of the studies/sources you are working with. For example, the second source
in a set of three, can be specified using a call such as datasources=connection.xyz[2].
On the other hand, if you wish to specify solely the first and third sources, the
appropriate call will be datasources=connections.xyz[c(1,3)]</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Clientside function ds.DANGERsearch calling serverside aggregate
function DANGERsearchDS. Only argument to be specified is datasouces.
ds.DANGERsearch is currently classified
as a DANGER function. This is because it is primarily of value to developers
and for other users to be proactively presented with the names of all of the serverside 
R environments may not be a good strategy from the perspective of optimising security.
In the future, if there is a demand, this could be converted to an open function.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a vector of character strings to the clientside giving the names of
each of the R environments on the serverside in order of their numeric &quot;pos&quot;
