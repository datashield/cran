<h2>DANGER FUNCTION copying clientside matrix to serverside</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Creates a matrix A on the serverside from matrix A on the clientside
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>DANGERc2sMATDFDS(
  mdata.transmit,
  from,
  nrows.transmit,
  ncols.transmit,
  colnames.transmit,
  colclass.transmit,
  byrow,
  dimnames
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>mdata.transmit</code></td>
<td>
<p>is a character string in a format that can pass through
the DataSHIELD R parser which specifies the name of the matrix or
data.frame to be copied from the clientside to the serverside.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>from</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character string specifying the source and nature of &lt;mdata&gt;.
Fixed by clientside function to &quot;clientside.matdf&quot;.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>nrows.transmit</code></td>
<td>
<p>specifies the number of rows in the matrix to be created
in a format that can pass through the DataSHIELD R parser. Fixed by the clientside
function as equal to the number of rows in the clientside matrix to be transferred</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>ncols.transmit</code></td>
<td>
<p>specifies the number of columns in the matrix to be created
in a format that can pass through the DataSHIELD R parser. Fixed by the clientside
function as equal to the number of columns in the clientside matrix to be transferred</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>colnames.transmit</code></td>
<td>
<p>a transmissable vector specifying the name of each column
in the matrix or data.frame being transferred from clientside to serverside.
Generated automatically by clientside function.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>colclass.transmit</code></td>
<td>
<p>a transmissable vector specifying the class of the vector representing
each column in the matrix or data.frame being transferred from clientside to serverside.
Generated automatically by clientside function. This allows the transmission of data.frames
containing data of multiple classes.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>byrow</code></td>
<td>
<p>a logical value specifying whether the matrix created on the serverside
should be filled row by row or column by column fixed by the clientside function
as FALSE (fill column by column).</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>dimnames</code></td>
<td>
<p>A dimnames attribute for the matrix: NULL or a list of length 2 giving
the row and column names respectively. An empty list is treated as NULL,
and a list of length one as row names only. If NULL (the default) the column names
of the original &lt;mdata&gt; data.frame or matrix are taken across to specify the 
column names of the serverside matrix</p>
</td></tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>DANGERc2sMATDF is a serverside assign function called by ds.DANGERc2sMATDF
This is a DANGER FUNCTION because it gives the clientside analyst
a lot of power to create a data structure that is precise and complex
on the severside. In fact this may be absolutely fine - the general rule is that
concerns about disclosure relate entirely to aggregate functions rather than
assign functions. However, for the moment this wil be kept as a DANGER FUNCTION
and could later be considered for conversion to a standard function, if requested.
This DANGER function was created from the ds.matrix function.
A number of the parameters specifying the matrix to be generated
are fixed by the nature of the clientside matrix
itself rather than by explicitly stating them as arguments. In consequence, 
they have been removed from the list of arguments and are instead given invariant
values in the first few lines of code. These include: from&lt;-&quot;clientside.matdf&quot;,
nrows.scalar=NULL, ncols.scalar=NULL, byrow = FALSE. The &lt;from&gt; argument
was originally a character string specifying the source and nature of &lt;mdata&gt;. Because
this DANGER function is only intended to copy a clientside matrix or data.frame to the
serverside, its value is fixed to &quot;clientside.matdf&quot;. The &lt;nrows.scalar&gt;
and &lt;ncols.scalar&gt; are fixed empirically by the number of rows and columns of
the matrix to be transferred. &lt;byrow&gt; specifies writing the serverside matrix by
columns or rows and this is always set as by column (i.e. FALSE).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>the object specified by the &lt;newobj&gt; argument (or default name &quot;new_matrix&quot;)
which is written as a data.frame to the serverside. In addition,
two validity messages are returned indicating whether &lt;newobj&gt; has been created in each
data source and if so whether it is in a valid form.
